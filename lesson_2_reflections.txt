1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An empty repository is created. If the user runs 'git status' it will see that no commits are created yet and shows the untracked files.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a middle stage when you've added files to be commited, but has not been committed to make a repository. It gives the user the optortunity to reset a committed file, or add another file, before making a repository.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the staging area to commit mulitple files, making it easy to make one commit per logical change.
