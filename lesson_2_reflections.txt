1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An empty repository is created. If the user runs 'git status' it will see that no commits are created yet and shows the untracked files.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a middle stage when you've added files to be commited, but has not been committed to make a repository. It gives the user the optortunity to reset a committed file, or add another file, before making a repository.
