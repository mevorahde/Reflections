1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   When you are working on a team or would like feedback on your project from others on the internet. 

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	As a double check to make sure that your local copy does not have different code than what is in the remote repository or vise versa. I could see this being a bigger caution when working on a project with a team.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- Forking: creating a copy of a repository ONLY via github
	- Clones: creating a copy of a repository, local of via github
	- Branches: creating a seperate local copy of a repository
